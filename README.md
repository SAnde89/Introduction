I'm a freshman at Purdue University majoring in Computer Science. Passionate about tech, I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to find efficient solutions in software development, data science, and machine learning. My interests lie in areas like machine learning, image processing techniques, and software development.

Beyond the classroom, I’ve contributed to various projects, ranging from software to make coding accessible for a younger audience creating an iOS app using TypeScript and React Native. I’m also exploring internships to expand my skills in real-world environments.
